My approach to designing software is to collect the requirements from the client or user first. Then once I have all the requirements, I will begin to design the flowchart of inputs
and outputs. Once I have the logic written out and mapped, I will begin to creat any classes and high level functions that need to be designed. Then with each piece
of code being written, I will create unit tests to test the code and ensure it is functioning as intended. Once I have the software or application in a place I can present to the 
client, I will sit down with them to review. Then fix any bugs that occur or chanes they wish to make. Computer science will help me achieve my goals as web developer or andoid
application developer by continuing to learn the fundamentals and best practices.
